This Python script uses the turtle graphics library to draw a colorful spiral pattern. The script creates a turtle.Pen object and sets the background color to white. It then iterates 360 times, changing the pen color cyclically through a list of six colors (red, purple, blue, green, orange, yellow) and adjusting the pen width dynamically. The turtle moves forward by the current iteration count and turns left by 59 degrees to create the spiral effect.
